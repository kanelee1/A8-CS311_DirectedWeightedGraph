# A8-CS311_DirectedWeightedGraph

program will read city data and road data from two files.
- city.txt -- It contains info of 20 cities with 5 columns: ID, City_Code(2 letters), City_Name, Population, and Elevation.
- road.txt -- It contains 3 columns: From_City, To_City, and Distance. Note that each road is one-directional from the from_city to the to_city, and the distances are not supposed to realistic. 

The executable should be called `main` and run with two command-line arguments. The first argument is the two-letter code of the from_city and the second argument is the code of the to_city. For example:
```
./main AN BK
```
When the program runs, it should first print out your group names and the info about the two cities, for example:
```
Author: xxxxxx and xxxxxxx
Date: xx/xx/20xx
Course: CS311 (Data structures and Algorithms)
Description : Program to find the shortest route between cities 
----------------------------------------------------------------
From City: ANAHEIM, population 1273000, elevation 310
To City: BAKERSFIELD, population 31100, elevation 390
```
Then it prints out the shortest route, for example:
```
The shortest distance from ANAHEIM to BAKERSFIELD is 225
through the route: ANAHEIM->VICTORVILLE->CHINO->GRPVE->ISABELLA->BAKERSFIELD
```
If the input city code dosen't exist, the program should exit and print out an error message, for example 
```
Invalid city code: AA
```
If there is not a path between two cities, it should print out 
```
No route from WRIGHTWOOD to KERNVILLE
```
